# Mobarez — Progress

**Status date:** 14 September 2026  
**Product stage:** private playable PvE MVP (`0.1.0`)  
**Next milestone:** U0 — gender-first creation, a visible full-body character, wearable equipment, and cosmetic costumes.

[Overview and setup](README.md) · [Development plan](PLAN.md) · [Character UX](docs/UX.md) · [Research](docs/research.md)

This is an evidence record, not a completion percentage. “Implemented” means the behavior exists in source. It does not imply browser verification, production load testing, or player validation. Historical checks below are dated; they were not rerun merely to edit this documentation.

## Version 0.2 — month-long Gladiatus-style game — 24 September 2026

Goal: make the game play like Gladiatus and hold a player for at least a month. Implemented in source on branch `claude/upbeat-franklin-empkd4`; **not yet deployed**.

Known limits: no wearable art for helmet/shield/gloves/boots/ring (icons are shown); later provinces reuse the three-portrait enemy atlas with colour treatment; arena rivals are NPCs, not players; balance is bot-tested, not player-tested.

## Character UX design update — 14 September 2026

The user prioritized choosing gender first, then seeing a character wear equipment and costumes. The [UX specification](docs/UX.md) defines onboarding, desktop/mobile layouts, slot and inventory interactions, costume precedence, save compatibility, asset requirements, and acceptance criteria. [The generated concept](docs/ux/character-concept.png) illustrates the visual direction; [its provenance](docs/ux/character-concept.md) records the exact prompt and limitations.

| Deliverable                                        | Status                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| User requirements and reference interpretation     | Documented                                                                     |
| Character creation / equipment / wardrobe UX       | Specified                                                                      |
| Original static visual concept                     | Generated and visually inspected; not a production sprite set                  |
| U0 implementation sequence and acceptance criteria | Added to PLAN                                                                  |
| Gender/name onboarding in the running game         | Implemented in source; engine/API tests cover setup, migration and locks       |
| Full-body character with visible item layers       | Implemented with sliced female/male outfit variants plus weapon/charm overlays |
| Cosmetic wardrobe and later gender editing         | Implemented; two owned costumes and `setGender`                                |
| Appearance save migration and API actions          | Implemented (`saveVersion` 1, `createCharacter`, `setGender`, `wearCostume`)   |
| Browser validation of the new UX                   | Not yet recorded as a complete acceptance pass                                 |

Design defaults: gender affects appearance only; later gender changes retain progress; two initial private-MVP costumes are free cosmetics; visible equipment keeps the current three slots. No new application release was made for this implementation until U0.4 verification.

### Engine coverage

The [13 tests](tests/engine.test.ts) cover:

- Starter victory, rewards, enemy unlocks, and input-state immutability.
- Locked enemies, regions, and dungeon entry.
- Cooldown and insufficient-energy rejection.
- Passive recovery, partial intervals, and caps.
- Purchases, ownership, equipment changes, selling, food, and insufficient gold.
- Early quest-claim rejection and one-time payouts.
- Level gain, stat gain, and health refill.
- Defeat consequences and recovery from one health.
- Dungeon stages, completion reward, and replay reset.
- Full-inventory expedition loot conversion and sale of duplicate equipped items.
- Training costs and maximum-health changes.
- Seeded starter encounters and basic content-value checks.

### Local API coverage

The [smoke script](scripts/api-smoke.mjs) verified unauthenticated GET rejection, local sign-in, persisted renaming, duplicate request handling, stale revisions, concurrent writes, invalid items, an unearned quest claim, malformed JSON, and cross-site rejection.

It does **not** verify two independent users, full hosted combat, every malformed action shape, multi-action retry history, or the complete UI journey. Its assumptions and data mutations are documented in [README.md](README.md#validation).

U0 is the next requested product milestone; P0 remains the private-MVP correctness gate; P1 follows or supports it before wider testing; P2 can follow once the core journey is dependable. These priorities are not claims of observed production incidents.

## Decisions retained

- Keep the product focused on Persian PvE in an original Iranian fantasy setting.
- Preserve the implemented RTL layout while addressing verified usability defects.
- Keep combat, costs, rewards, unlocks, and timers authoritative on the server.
- Use accelerated timers for the MVP; treat session-length targets as hypotheses.
- Keep dungeon combat solo until a separate party design is justified.
- Keep the hosted prototype owner-only unless its audience is explicitly changed.
- Keep stable content IDs compatible with stored saves.

## Work not started

Public account registration/recovery, mercenary parties, repeatable quests, new region-specific art, analytics, admin tools, PvP, guilds, auctions, and payments have not been implemented. Browser acceptance for the new character flow, reward-edge-case fixes, and the broader save-recovery program remain open. Their presence in research or planning documents does not imply delivery.

## Next checkpoint

Validate U0 against [the UX acceptance matrix](docs/UX.md#12-acceptance-matrix) in a real browser, then record the tested revision. Carry forward P0 browser verification and reward fixes. Update this file with evidence when each task finishes; leave unexecuted checks marked unverified.
